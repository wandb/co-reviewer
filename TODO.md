# Implementation Plan for co-reviewer Tool

## 1. Project Setup and Configuration

- Create the repository structure under /core/tools/co-reviewer.
- Use pnpm to manage dependencies and install required Node.js libraries for backend and frontend (e.g., express, react, axios, diff libraries).
- Prepare environment configuration (e.g., .env file) for GitHub secrets such as the token, repository details, and pull request number.

## 2. GitHub API Integration

### a. Changed Files

- Build a service that calls the GitHub API endpoint: GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:pull_number/files.
- Parse the list of changed files along with diff information.

### b. Code Owners

- Determine the code owners for each file using either the GitHub API (if available) or by parsing the CODEOWNERS file.
- Map file paths to owner usernames.

### c. Reviews

- Build a service that retrieves review data using the GitHub API endpoint: GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:pull_number/reviews.
- Associate each review with its respective file(s).

### d. Error Handling & Caching

- Ensure API calls handle errors gracefully.
- Implement caching for API responses to minimize calls and avoid GitHub rate limits.

## 3. Data Modeling and Aggregation

- Define models for:
  - FileChange (filename, diff content, status)
  - CodeOwner (username, associated files)
  - Review (reviewer, review status, comments, associated files)
- Create a data aggregation layer that merges file changes with information from code ownership and reviews.
- Compute unreviewed changes and determine responsibilities for each code owner reviewer.

## 4. Frontend Implementation

- Set up a Next.js React-based UI (or similar) to serve as the browser interface.

### a. Diff View

- Utilize a side-by-side diff view component to display file changes.
- Integrate a diffing library for clear visualization of diffs.

### b. Filter Controls

- Implement UI elements (dropdowns or checkboxes) to filter files by code owner and review status.
- Dynamically update the display as filters change.

### c. Data Fetching

- Connect the frontend to backend endpoints that aggregate the GitHub data.
- Display loading indicators and handle errors gracefully.

## 5. Backend (Server) Implementation

- Build an API server using Next.js to act as middleware between GitHub and the frontend.
- Create endpoints (e.g., GET /review-data) that return aggregated file change, code owner, and review information.
- Ensure efficient processing and transformation of GitHub data for frontend consumption.

## 6. Deployment and Usage Documentation

- Update the README with installation instructions (pnpm install) and startup commands (pnpm run dev).
- Provide detailed documentation on configuration, GitHub API interaction, and how to interpret diff views and filter controls.
- Include guidelines for local development and running tests.

## 7. Additional Considerations

- API Rate Limits: Implement retry logic and caching to avoid exceeding limits.
- Access Control: Ensure that only authorized code owners can access sensitive data.
- UI/UX: Design an intuitive and responsive interface with clear visual indicators for reviewed versus unreviewed changes.
- Logging and Monitoring: Integrate logging for troubleshooting and monitoring both API errors and user interactions in production.
